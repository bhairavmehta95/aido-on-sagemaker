    "# Welcome to Duckietown!\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the companion tutorial file for learning how to use Amazon AWS's Sagemaker tool to train your Duckietown AIDO submission... **in the cloud**!\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be building off our [Reinforcement Learning](https://goo.gl/YFTjn3) Tutorial, where we take DDPG and use Sagemaker to train with speed!\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will walk you through, step by step, how to get your Sagemaker account running and using it to train a AIDO Lane Following Submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some prerequisites we expect you to have:\n",
    "1. A Git and an AWS Account (You can get one by signing up [here](https://aws.amazon.com/))\n",
    "2. A good overview of the code we'll be looking at. We'll be building off [this repository](https://github.com/duckietown/challenge-aido1_LF1-baseline-RL-sim-pytorch), and this code can be found [here](https://github.com/duckietown/aido-on-sagemaker). A good start would be the video tutorial posted above.\n",
    "3. The ability to submit with `duckietown-shell` (which means you already have a [Duckietown Account](https://www.duckietown.org/research/ai-driving-olympics/ai-do-register)) as well as `git` on your computer\n",
    "4. A **fork** of [this repository](https://github.com/duckietown/aido-on-sagemaker), which contains the two IPython notebooks we'll look at.\n",

    "## Getting Started with AWS and Sagemaker\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why AWS and the Cloud?\n",
    "\n",
    "After watching all of our other video tutorials, you may have thought that you had everything you needed to start training a reinforcement learning or imitation learning agent. But, when you attempted to train, you saw that training was too slow, took too much memory, or even froze your computer. Modern day deep learning techniques require a lot of computing power to train, more than what's often available on your laptop.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common method is to then use a cloud provider - where you essentially rent time on powerful machines with more GPU, RAM, and resources. AWS is the largest provider of such cloud services, and as a result, they have put a lot of effort into building out tools that make it easier to train and deploy models at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Sagemaker?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sagemaker, a new tool from AWS, abstracts away even more of the building, training, and deploying steps involved in machine learning. While we won't be using the Sagemaker functionality to deploy a model, we will take advantage of its awesome capabilities to deploy instances, train large models, and quickly view and save our results. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating an AWS Account\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to create an [AWS Account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup) for the remainder of the tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a Notebook Instance\n",
    "\n",
    "Navigate to the [Sagemaker homepage](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/home) and click on Notebook Instances. Sagemaker's heavily integrated with Jupyter Notebooks, which is already a powerful tool for machine learning researchers and data scientists. Now, with Sagemaker, we can use our same notebook to train models on powerful AWS instances. \n",
    "\n",
    "You then want to \"Create notebook instance\" and give it a name like \"duckietown-aido-cloud\". We'll skip over the instance type until the next section, and focus on IAM role. \n",
    "\n",
    "IAM is an AWS security feature that serves as their identification and access service. IAM helps you control what things in your AWS account get what permissions, which makes sure that you don't need to worry too much about security.\n",
    "\n",
    "Click \"Create New Role\" in the IAM dropdown, leave all the other options the same, and proceed to the instance type.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What type of Instance do I use?\n",
    "\n",
    "AWS, like other cloud providers, offer many types of **instances**. An Instance is a machine that you \"rent\" out, and depending on what type of instance you get, the faster training may go (especially if you get a GPU). The important thing to remember is that all instances are not priced the same, and better instances will cost more per hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find a description of each instance [here](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### CPU or GPU?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've done a bit of Deep Learning, you'll know that libraries like Tensorflow, Pytorch, and MXNet all come with GPU-acceleration built in. A GPU can be extremely useful, especially when training RL agents, which require tons of samples. While the rest of this tutorial will assume that you've picked the lowest one, `ml.t2.medium`, feel free to pick a more powerufl instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "For GPU instances, you can find a description of the various GPU-enabled Accelerated Computing instances [here](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Paying Close Attention to the Region\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of this tutorial will assume that the region (top-right of the screen) is set to `us-east-1`. This describes what region your instance is located in, If it's not `us-east-1`, don't worry - just keep a note of where you are! \n",
    "\n",
    "#### I'm a student | competitor | academic instructor - How can I pay for this?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you notice the prices when clicking through some of the above links, you'll notice AWS instances are not free. But if you're here, that's good news! We'll be posting a link to a form, where you can sign up at the end of this tutorial to get **free AWS credits**!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Jupyter Notebook Tips + Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "New to Jupyter? At any point, click the \"Help\" section in the toolbar, and click through some of the references. Or, ask a question at anytime in a comment on our Facebook Live video, or on the Duckietown forums!\n",
    "\n",
    "**All Done - Now, Click <kbd>Create Notebook Instance</kbd>**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting the Correct IAM Permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "While your new notebook is getting setup, we can take care of another thing we'll need later on in the tutorial. Navigate to the [IAM Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home), and click on *Roles*. You'll see your new Sagemaker Role, so click on it. When the page loads, you'll see a big button that says <kbd>Attach Policies</kbd>. There, you'll want to *filter* policies by entering this: `AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess`, and attach it to your role. This will allow us to pull and push containers to the EC2 Container Registry later on in the tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cloning our Baseline inside of the Sagemaker Notebook Instances\n",
    "\n",
    "Navigate back to the [Sagemaker homepage](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/home), and you'll see that your notebook is ready! Click `Open Jupyter`, and you'll soon be greeted with the familiar IPython Notebook / Jupyter Navigation page. If you're more comfortable with the newer JupyterLab, click that in the top right corner.\n",
    "\n",
    "To clone this repository, you'll want to click <kbd>New</kbd> and click on `Terminal`. When the terminal opens, you'll want to type the following commands to clone your forked repository containing this code inside of your Notebook instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ cd Sagemaker\n",
    "$ git clone https://github.com/{YOUR-GIT-USERNAME}/aido-on-sagemaker/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And then exit the terminal, click on *Aido-on-Sagemaker* and click on the IPython Notebook!"
